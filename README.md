## kNN-overlap-finder
This repository contains all testing, data processing, benchmarking, and evaluation workflows for the development and publication of FEDRANN software (https://github.com/jzhang-dev/FEDRANN). It is designed to ensure full reproducibility of the results presented in our associated article.

## Key Components
1. Data Simulation\
Scripts for generating synthetic datasets with controlled parameters:\
​​PBSIM3-based simulation​​: Varied depth, accuracy, and read length configurations

2. Real Data Processing\
Pipelines for processing empirical sequencing data:\
Quality control and filtering\
Format conversion and normalization\
Metadata management

3. Tool Benchmarking\
Uniform benchmarking workflows for multiple tools:\
​​Fedrann​​: Our proposed method\
​​Comparative tools​​: minimap2, MHAP, MECAT2, wtdbg2, xRead, and BLEND

5. Results Evaluation
